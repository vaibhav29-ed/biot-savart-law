# ðŸ§  About the Project

When I was in my 12th class, I studied the Biotâ€“Savart Law in Physics â€” a concept describing how steady electric currents create magnetic fields. It fascinated me, but the visuals were mostly static and theoretical.

In my first year of engineering, I decided to build this simulation from scratch to better understand both the **physics theory** and **programming concepts.

This project numerically simulates the magnetic field around:
- A straight current-carrying wire
- A circular current loop
- (Optional) A random-shaped loop

It uses the vector form of the Biotâ€“Savart Law and calculates magnetic field vectors at grid points in 3D space.
